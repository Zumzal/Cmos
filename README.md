Core assignment

- You're given a reference current which can vary between 1 µA and 32 µA. Model this as an ideal DC current source with a 10 GΩ output resistance (placed in parallel with the current source).
- Design an oscillator which outputs a square wave whose minimal and maximal frequency are limited to 500 kHz and 100 MHz respectively. The frequency of the square wave is linear to the reference current. The minimal current-to-frequency gain is 100 kHz/µA.
- Measure the frequency for different values of the reference current (1 µA, 2 µA, 4 µA, 8 µA, 16 µA, 32 µA) and write down these simulation results (as text in the .asc file, in an Excel file...). The nonlinearity (maximum deviation from a measurement to linear trendline) should be less than 10%. The more linear, the better.
- Explain which electrical parameters determine the frequency of the oscillator. Write this down with the appropriate formules as text in the .asc file.
  
# Questions 
- How does an oscillator work ? 
- Why does exactly 3 nmos pmos pair make an oscillator ? 
- Why do i need an odd number of nmos pmos pairs to have an oscillator ? 
- Why does a pair number create an alternating signalvoltage soruce ?
- using 0s of rise and fall time not realistic ?
